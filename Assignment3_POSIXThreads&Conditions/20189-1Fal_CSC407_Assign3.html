  <h4>Purpose:</h4>
  <P>To practice working with POSIX threads, mutexes and conditions;
     and to practice good pointer programming in C</P>

  <h4>Assignment:</h4>
  <ol type="1">
<li><h4>The &quot;telephone&quot; game (50 Points)</h4>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>
    We are going to simulate the children's game of &quot;telephone&quot;.
    In this game N (in our case, 10) children are in a circle.
    The first one says something to the second.
    The second one may or may not hear what the first one said accurately but he/she passes what he/she <em>thinks</em> was said to the third.
    This continues until the message gets to the last child.
  </p>

  <p>
    The program for our game has two classes.
    The first one, <code>Sentence</code> holds the current state of a sentence.
    It has been written for you, and all you have to do is use it.
    The second one, <code>MessageSystem</code> holds mutexes, conditions and sentence pointer buffers between each child.
    You'll have to finish this one.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>For this assignment you have to:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You have to fill in the mutex and condition portions of <code>MessageSystem</code>.
      <li>Write the function <code>void* child (void*)</code> that the child threads will run.
      <li>Finish <code>main()</code> to invoke and wait for the child threads.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <P>
    Each child <code>i</code> will get the pointer to its sentence from <code>i-1</code> and will transmit it (imperfectly) to <code>i</code>.
    Thus it needs to access two buffers: one at <code>i-1</code> and the other at <code>i</code>.
    All buffers are protected by mutexes, so child <code>i-1</code> and child <code>i</code> don't step on each other's toes when trying to access the buffer at <code>i-1</code>.
  </p>

  <P>
    Before child <code>i</code> can get the sentence pointer from the buffer at <code>i-1</code> the sentence has to be there.
    If it is not it should temporarily surrender the lock (if it obtained it) and wait until the sentence becomes available.
  </p>

</pre>
      <p>
      </p>

    <li><h4>Finish <code>class MessageSystem</code></h4>
      <p>
	The class needs two more arrays: one of NUM_CHILDREN+1 pthread-mutexes and another of NUM_CHILDREN+1 pthread-conditions.
	All the objects in both arrays should be initialized in the constructor, destroyed in the destructor, and should have pointers returned in <code>getLockPtr()</code> and <code>getCondPtr()</code>.
      </p>

    <li><h4>Write <code>void* child (void* argPtr)</code></h4>
      <p>
      </p>
	<ol type="A">
	  <li>It might be useful to define an integer variable <code>index</code> corresponding to the integer pointed to by <code>argPtr</code>.
	      Please note that <code>argPtr</code> has type <code>void*</code> and therefore does not know it points to an integer.
	    <p></p>

	  <li>A simple <code>cout</code> statement should suffice here.
	    <p></p>

	  <li>Time for mutexes!
	    See that if statement?
	    In the &quot;then&quot; part of it lock <code>messageSystem.getLockPtr(index)</code> first and <code>messageSystem.getLockPtr(index-1)</code> second.
	    In the &quot;else&quot; part of it lock <code>messageSystem.getLockPtr(index-1)</code> first and <code>messageSystem.getLockPtr(index)</code> second.
	    (We do this to try to convince ourselves that our program is robust over the vagaries of timing.)
	    Then we <code>cout</code>.
	    Finally we <em>loop</em> while our incoming message is not yet ready (method <code>isReady(index-1)</code>).
	    In this loop we should wait to be signaled.
	    <p></p>

	  <li>Here we've got to get a <code>Sentence*</code> (method <code>giveSentencePtr(index-1)</code>).
	    We print out what we got and call method <code>imperfectlyTransmit()</code> on it (how do you run a method on an object given a pointer to it?).
	    Finally we set the updated sentence with <code>setSentencePtr(index,<em>yourSentencePtrVar</em>)</code>
	    <p></p>

	  <li>We got both locks <code>index-1</code> and <code>index</code>, and here we unlock them.
	    Further, we should signal that there's a <code>Sentence</code> pointer in the buffer at index for child index+1.
	    <p></p>

	</ol>

    <li><h4>Finish <code>int main ()</code></h4>
  <p>
    We need an array of NUM_CHILDREN+1 pthreads.
    This array will be initialized in the first loop, where all child threads are to run your function <code>child()</code> and all are passed the <em>address</em> of <code>indices[childIndex]</code>.
    The child threads are initialized in <em>reverse</em> order to show how robust our solution is; our children are <em>well-behaved</em> and will not <strong>throw a tantrum</strong> if made to wait.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the second loop we wait for each thread to finish.
  </p>
