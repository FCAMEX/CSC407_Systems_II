  <h4>Overview:</h4>
  <p>
    A  <em>student</em> approaches the <em>Dean</em> of the College
    to take a science class.
    The Dean assigns a <em>prof</em>,
    who is smart and capable, but is also very tired.
    If the professor falls asleep while giving the lecture
    then the student will wait for
    <code>NUM_SNORES_BEFORE_STUDENT_COMPLAINS</code>
    snores before waking the professor.
    On the <code>NUM_COMPLAINTS_TO_PROF_BEFORE_COMPLAIN_TO_DEAN</code>-th
    attempt the student bypasses the prof and goes straight to the dean,
    who also yells at the prof.

     and then do <code>exit(EXIT_FAILURE);</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     The student should have 3 handlers:
     <ol type="a">
       <li>
	 A <code>CLASS_DISMISSED_SIGNAL</code> handler.
	 It ends the <code>sleep()</code> loop in <code>main()</code>.
	 It should also display a message saying the student will quit:
	 <pre>
printf(&quot;Student \&quot;Time for lunch!\&quot;\n&quot;);
	 </pre>
       </li>
       <li>
	 A <code>PROF_TEACH_SIGNAL</code> handler.
	 It just prints the following:
	 <pre>
printf(&quot;(Student scribbles notes.)\n&quot;);
	 </pre>
       </li>
       <li>
	 A <code>PROF_SNORE_SIGNAL</code> handler.
	 <p>
	   This handler should keep track of two things:
	   <ol type="1">
	     <li>The number of times the student was recently snored at</li>
	     <li>The number of times the student recently complained to the prof</li>
	   </ol>
	   Every time it is called it should increment the number of times the student was recently snored at.
	   <ol>
	     <li>
	       If this is less than
	       <code>NUM_SNORES_BEFORE_STUDENT_COMPLAINS</code>
	       then it should just print:
	       <pre>
printf(&quot;Student \&quot;%s?\&quot;\n&quot;,PROFS_NAME);
	       </pre>
	     </li>
	     <li>
	       Else, it should
	       <ol type="a">
		 <li>
		   Reset the number of times the student was
		   recently snored at to <code>0</code>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		   Increment the number of times the
		   student recently complained to the prof.
		 </li>
		 <li>
		   If that count is less than
		   <code>NUM_COMPLAINTS_TO_PROF_BEFORE_COMPLAIN_TO_DEAN</code>
		   then it should send <code>COMPLAIN_SIGNAL</code> to the
		   prof process (its parent) and print
		   <pre>
printf(&quot;Student \&quot;%s!\&quot;\n&quot;,PROFS_NAME);
		   </pre>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		   If the count is greater than or equal to
		   <code>NUM_COMPLAINTS_TO_PROF_BEFORE_COMPLAIN_TO_DEAN</code>
		   then it should send <code>COMPLAIN_SIGNAL</code> to the
		   dean process, set the count to <code>0</code> and print
		   <pre>
printf(&quot;Student \&quot;I have had enough!  I'm calling the Dean.\&quot;\n&quot;);
		   </pre>
		 </li>
	       </ol>
	     </li>
	   </ol>
	 </p>
       </li>
     </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      After installing the handlers,
      <code>main()</code> should just do a <code>sleep()</code> loop
      waiting for the program to end.
      I had:
      <pre>
  while  (isStillClassTime)
  {
    sleep(1);
  }

  return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
      </pre>

Prof &quot;Huh?  What?  Oops!  I must have fallen asleep!&quot;
Prof &quot;Now as I was saying . . .&quot;
Prof &quot;F = m*a is a special case of F = dp/dt = m*dv/dt + v*dm/dt when dm/dt = 0.

Prof &quot;The electron-electron repulsion between atoms and molecules supports the s
tructure of most matter at our scale. If gravity overcomes this electron repulsi
on, then electrons collapse into the nucleus and matter becomes a neutron star.&quot;
